# heating-remote

Branch gif is the most updated.

Using the default Sapper template, I built an App to control the heating remotely.
My heating didn't have a thermostate, and I had a Raspberry Pi and a relay laying around the room.

Now I can control the heating from a website, with a button.

As a next step, I'd like to also have a thermometer to have a proper thermostate so I set a desired temperature.

Please open issues or send and email to irekepa@gmail.
